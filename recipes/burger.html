        <h2>Natural sugars in the meat caramelize, making the patty extra delicious</h2>

        <p>This is a good burger. It is the best burger, actually. Some men and women eat this with a glass of red wine.
            It has a tremendous amount of flavor. The fresh tomatoes are sliced by hand, and add value to the burger overall.
            A very generous amount of salt and pepper needs to be added to the burger so it doesn't taste stale.

        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped tarragon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>12 ounces thickly sliced bacon</li>
            <li>1 1/3 pounds ground beef chuck</li>
            <li>1 1/3 pounds ground beef sirloin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>3 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, cut into 6 slices</li>
            <li>6 hamburger buns, split and toasted</li>
            <li>6 iceberg lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>6 slices of tomato</li>
            <li>6 slices of red onion</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the mayonnaise with the ketchup, red wine vinegar, onion, parsley, tarragon and 
                worcestershire sauce. Cover and refrigerate.
            </li>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook the bacon over moderately high heat, turning once, until crisp, about 6 minutes.
                Drain and cut the bacon into large pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Light a grill and fill a large bowl with ice water. Gently mix the ground chuck with the ground sirloin, 
                salt and pepper. Form the meat into six 4-inch patties, about 11/4 inches thick. Submerge the patties in
                the cold water and let soak for 30 seconds. Immediately transfer the burgers to the grill and brush with
                some of the melted butter. Grill over high heat for 9 minutes for medium-rare meat, turning once or twice
                and brushing occasionally with butter. Top the burgers with the cheese during the last minute of grilling
                and let melt.
            </li>
            <li>Spread the Russian dressing on the buns. Set the lettuce leaves and tomato slices on the bottom halves and
                top with the burgers, red onion and bacon. Close the burgers, cut in half and serve right away.
