        <h2>Add in slices of banana to enhance the flavor of this great dish</h2>

        <p>The amount of flavor in this recipe is outstanding. Oats are good, and so are bananas. The sugary taste of this dish will 
            have you craving more and more peanut butter in the evenings when nobody else is around. There is also vanilla flavor added, 
            and this ingredient makes the dish even more tasty for many people.
